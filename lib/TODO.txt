BUGS

when messages are sent by one user and then another in the foreground, 
the app for both, iOS and Android show 1 unread message for the badge
and the message info
=> nothing is wrong with the serve
=> something is wrong with the way the messages are either sent to the app
or read by the app i.e a problem in the cubit 
*it happens on a fresh start where the other user sends first
*it happens when the other user sends a message 
*the decrease method is called => that it should be decreasing but isnt
=> errors with 
1) initial cubit state
2) Sign in screen

start up
user
other
error

* on the error the log had the following output:
called
decrease
increase
=> the order when the other user sends is in the wrong order
=> the badge decreases first (0 -> 0) and then increases (0 -> 1)
instead of increasing (0 -> 1) and then decreasing (1 -> 0)
=> not a database error

fixed with an internal queue. Everytime the request fires I put that request
in an async queue and wait for it to finish and then I call the next one. 


messages at the top for both systems tends to flip when a new message is sent
and when the user looks at it (i.e. the state is updated to seen) the order
changes to the correct ordering
=> error in the ordering?
