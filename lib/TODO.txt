TO TODO
set up the official twilio account
have the drivers able to enter their date, time, driver, vehicle and purpose
export that to excel
api?

BUGS
ordering of messages get messed up
why, maybe bc: 
1) too much and the sorting does not have enough time

Android notification- on the background has a different cache for shared_preferences than the foreground 
When the cross over receipts are sent to the driver, it increments the unread messages and does not decrement
*check if reloading the cache does anything


COMPLETED
Added the errand user so a requestee does not always need to be assigned 
Fixed the bug where the unread messages counter increments unnecessarily
Added the cars to admin screen
enter which car 
make a separate form for the bottom elements that car be validated with confirm and not with update
add car to the dispatcher
